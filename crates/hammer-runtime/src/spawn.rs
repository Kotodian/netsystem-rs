//! Tracing-aware `tokio::spawn` wrapper.
//!
//! Every Service owns its own `tracing::Dispatch` (see `Factory::dispatch`),
//! attached on the calling thread before lifecycle work begins. The bare
//! `tokio::spawn` does not propagate the calling thread's dispatcher to the
//! spawned task, so the task would lose its routing once the worker thread
//! polls it. `tracing::instrument::WithSubscriber::with_current_subscriber`
//! captures the dispatcher at spawn time and attaches it to the future, so
//! subsequent polls re-enter that dispatcher regardless of which worker
//! thread runs them. This is the standard tracing recipe for per-task
//! subscriber isolation under tokio's multi-threaded runtime.
//!
//! Use `crate::spawn::spawn(future)` everywhere we'd otherwise call
//! `tokio::spawn`. Forgetting it does not corrupt routing — it only causes
//! the task's events to be dropped (no global default subscriber is
//! installed) — but it should still be considered a bug.
